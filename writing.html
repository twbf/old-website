      <h2>Torture Is Never Ethical Opinion</h2>
      <h3>A comparison of CIA torture and Japanese POW torture in an opinion.</h3>
      <p>Torture is when a human being inflicts severe pain on another human being usually for punishment for nottelling them something. One of the somber things about this is that it is mostly for the enjoyment of the one inflicting pain. Torture destroys one’s emotional and physical state. Survival of torture depends on whether the individual  sustains the will to live through the nefarious treatment. Under international law torture is prohibited, but countries have gotten around the law, including the USA and Japan in World War 2. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) after 9/11 tortured at least 39 people with the following torture techniques:are waterboarding, chaining people to the wall in a standing position for 17 days, and other acts of torture.</p>
      <p>On December 9th, 2014 the senate released a report on CIA torture. Even though only 535 pages of the report were released to the public, the report is 6000 pages long. In the report it states that the enhanced interrogation techniques were not effective at achieving improved intelligence. Some of these techniques are anal feeding, sleep deprivation, waterboarding, and prolonged standing. These techniques are not enhanced interrogation, but torture in a cover to hide it. As an illustration, one prisoner was waterboarded 183 times. Waterboarding is when someone is restrained at around a 15 degree incline, and then a piece of cloth is laid over their mouth and nose. Then water is poured on the cloth making the victim feel a drowning sensation. There is a tremendous risk to waterboarding. For example, it can cause damage to the lungs and brain, and there is the risk of sudden death. Waterboarding is presumably being used by the Islamic State (ISIL) on their prisoners. The Islamic State is currently one of the United States’ middle eastern enemies. Even though the CIA says that waterboarding isn't torture, the UN states that it is since it was done intentionally. One person has even died from hypothermia after being tortured. At one point the CIA said that it had held under 100 prisoners, it actually held 119. This embarrassing fact shows how poor the record keeping of the CIA is. Because the CIA doesn’t want to admit that it did anything wrong, the CIA states that none of the techniques used were torture.</p>
      <p>Not only did the CIA physically harm detainees, but it also committed emotional abuse. To one detainee, an officer said that his mom was going to be brought to the same prison and raped in front of him. To another person, the CIA said that the only way he would get out of here is in a coffin. Furthermore, there was another prisoner who was told that if there were any more attacks on the US, all his children would be killed. The human mind is more fragile than we think it is, and this led to detainees to develop serious mental problems like paranoia, dementia, insomnia, and self harm attempts.</p>
      <p>The people the CIA tortured were what other countries would call POWs (Prisoners Of War). The U.S classifies some POWs as illegal enemy combatants so they can torture them without breaking international law. During WWII, Japan did the same thing. In the Independent, a United Kingdom newspaper, it had as its headline “America's Day Of Shame” the day after the report was released.</p>
      <p>During World War ll, the Japanese also tortured POWs. This is really pronounced in the book <i>Unbroken</i>, which is a biography of Louis Zamperini. Louis was soon to be the fastest miler in the world when WWII hit, and then he joined the army as a pilot. He was on a plane in WWII when the plane crashed; then he survived 47 days at sea. The feat broke the known world record at the time! Louis ran a 4:06 mile on the sand the day before the crash, and when he was rescued by the Japanese he could barely stand up. The mile record at that time was 4:01.2! Once he was captured, he survived “execution” island where practically every other allied soldier died. Then Louis was moved to another island where Louis was brutally tortured by Japanese guards, and a particularly vicious one namedMutsuhiro Watanabe.</p>
      <p>As a consequence, of this treatment, many other prisoners capitulated to the perpetual pain and suffering; so they died. All the prisoners nicknamed Watanabe “the bird”, so they could talk about him secretly. “The bird” tortured Louis more viciously since he was famous. Louis was tormented almost to insanity and knocked unconscious at least a dozen times. He remembers hearing the whip of the belt buckle, and then feeling the crack of it hit his skull. Just before the crash Louis weighed over hundred and fifty, he bottomed out at 70 pounds when he was a POW. Around a week before the Japanese surrendered, they massacred all the prisoners on some islands, so the allies wouldn’t find out how the prisoners had been treated. Other prison guards would try to stab prisoners with sticks to get a reaction out of them. Thirty-seven percent of American POWs died in Japan compared to 1% of American POWs in Germany. Thirty-four thousand six hundred forty-eight Americans died in POW camps in Japan.</p>
      <p>When Louis returned to California, he was greeted by reporters. Around a year after the war, he became an alcoholic and had lots of flashbacks of “the bird”. He had this obsession with killing the bird which made him even more distant from reality. Louis was so obsessed that he almost strangled his pregnant wife, thinking she was “the bird”. Surely this shows how much of a lasting impact torture has on human beings. Mutsuhito was thought to have died in the 1950s, but he actually lived until 2003 with no punishment for his actions. Louis died in 2014 after sustaining plethora of pain and suffering.</p>
      <p>In a significant part of the Muslim world, the image of the US is not a positive one because we tortured people and have not been punished. Not only was the torture program against the ethics of a majority of Americans, but there was also prevalent damage to our foreign policy. Whenever a country tortures its enemies, the rest of the world should not support that country. The UN has called for the prosecution of CIA officials who permitted the torture program, so this doesn’t become a precedent for other countries. Most Americans feel like Japan was wrong in how it treated American POWs in WWII, and we are following in Japan’s footsteps. We, the U.S., are a western country, and we look like a third world, barbarous country. Do you think that the US should be torturing people just like Japan did? Torture is an evil, unforgivable action that destroys people from the inside out. There is no guarantee that the US will not torture more people.</p>

      <h2>Singapore Government</h2>
      <p>Singapore has a government that is unlike any other government. It is extremely hard to decide how democratic or undemocratic a country is, so this essay is focusing on that. This essay is also focusing on how the Singapore government works because it is intricate. The Singapore government has a reputation of being excessively into peoples business. Singapore has a rather powerful government. This is particularly pronounced in this statement “Singapore’s power structure is highly centralized, characterized by a top-down style.” (guidemesingapore.com).</p>
      <p>The Singapore government is a democratic republic. This means that the power is derived from the citizens, and that the government is run by elected officials (singapore.sg). On the Corruption Index, which is a measure of how fair governments are, Singapore earned 5th overall for least corrupt. By perspective the United States ranks 19th out of 177 countries. Singapore is a socialist government like most European countries. This means that several of the private sector industries are controlled by the government. A law of thousands that genuinely affects the people of Singapore is that you must vote if you’re over 21 years of age, but you can’t vote if you are under 21. As you can see Singapore is doing very well on the corruption side of things, but it’s people don’t have as many rights as people in the United States.</p>
      <p>The Government of Singapore has a complex interworking in that when the president is elected, he appoints the prime minister. The prime minister is the head of the cabinet. This is similar to the United States, but in the US it is the president who is the head of the cabinet. Also in Singapore the constitution is the supreme law of the land. One significant difference between the United States and Singapore is that Singapore has a parliament. In Singapore the president and parliament are the Legislative branch. In the parliament of Singapore the People’s Action Party holds a mega-majority of 82 of 84 seats. There are countless other insignificant opposition parties, and they have exceedingly limited power.</p>
      <p>Singapore has a democratic government, and it has a one party system. Thereover the Singapore government is rather fair, but it does have it’s downsides.   Do you think the government of Singapore is favorable? Here is an answer from a protester: “Gone are the old days where the government believes what is the right thing to do and they don’t care what the public thinks and do what is right. Doing what is right is no longer enough” (bloomberg.com). <p>
